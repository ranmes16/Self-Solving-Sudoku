# Self-Solving Sudoku

## Overview

This project is a self-solving Sudoku puzzle solver implemented using the backtracking algorithm. The solver takes an unsolved Sudoku puzzle as input and returns a solved version of the puzzle.

## Features

- Efficiently solves any valid Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
- Provides a clear visualization of the solving process (if implemented in a GUI).
- Can handle puzzles with varying difficulty levels.

## How It Works

The solver uses the backtracking algorithm to fill the Sudoku grid. The algorithm works by placing a number in an empty cell and recursively trying to solve the rest of the puzzle. If placing the number leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks by removing the number and trying the next possible number.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ranmes16/self-solving-sudoku.git
